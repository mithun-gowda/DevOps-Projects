## Step 1: Set Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster

- Install Minikube on your local machine following the instructions provided in the Minikube documentation.
- Start Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster: minikube start.

## Step 2: Containerize the Game Application

- Dockerize your game application by creating a Dockerfile to package it into a container.
- Build the Docker image: docker build -t game-app:v1 .

## Step 3: Deploy the Game Application

- Create Kubernetes deployment manifests (deployment.yaml) for your game application.
- Apply the deployment to your Minikube cluster: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml.

## Step 4: Configure Ingress Controller

- Install NGINX Ingress Controller on your Minikube cluster following the instructions provided in the NGINX Ingress Controller documentation.
- Create an Ingress resource (ingress.yaml) to define the routing rules for your game application.
- Apply the Ingress resource: kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml.

## Step 5: Access the Game Application

- Obtain the Minikube IP address: minikube ip.
- Update your hosts file to map a domain name to the Minikube IP address.
- Access the game application via the domain name configured in the Ingress resource.

## Step 6: Monitoring and Management

- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring your Minikube cluster by following the instructions provided in their documentation.
- Monitor the performance and resource utilization of your Minikube cluster using Grafana dashboards.

## Step 7: Testing

- Test the scalability and performance of your game application on the Minikube cluster.
- Generate load on the application and observe how the NGINX Ingress Controller routes traffic and scales the application pods.


- By following these steps, you can deploy and manage your game application on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube and NGINX Ingress Controller without incurring charges from AWS. This approach allows you to experiment and develop your application in a cost-effective manner before scaling it to production environments.
